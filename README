Note: This plugin is finished, it shouldn't be, but it is because of the fact the Spout team decided to throw a fit and detach from Bukkit, killing Bukkit because developers used it's API in many plugins.
If the Spout development team reads this, I hate you, you managed to screw me, and so many other developers over because you couldn't stand not being on top, you just had to have it your way.
