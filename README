I'm Nicholas Krecklow (also known as @steaks4uce on many websites including Bukkit and Spout), I've created BasicHerbrine (the original version), HerobrineUnleashed (the old version), and now, to redeem myself and Herobrine, I've created Herobrine.
You can contact me by email or private messaging me on the Bukkit or Spout forums. My email is owner@nkrecklow.com, feel free to email me with any comments, questions, concerns, or ideas you may have.

As the successor of HerobrineUnleashed and BasicHerobrine, this plugin brings back the legend, the pain, the hell... him.<br /> 
Developed by Nicholas Krecklow, it is a complete rewrite of Herobrine and sets the legend right.
Herobrine is supposed to be a lost miner in Minecraft, often thought to be the lost brother of Notch. However, Herobrine never existed and was just a myth. If you would like to learn more, read up at http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Herobrine.
